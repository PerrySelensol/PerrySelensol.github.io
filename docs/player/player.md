***

In figura, there are four types of entities:

- `Player`: the player entity which uses this avatar;
- `LivingEntity`: living entities such as chickens, zombies;
- `Entity`: other entites such as boats, minecarts and;
- `Viewer`: the player entity of other people.

Being the most commonly used entity, `Player` is represented by a table called `player` which contains functions related to getting data of the player entity that uses this avatar.

The list below gives all the functions found in `player` table.

{: .warning}
> As these functions rely on the player entity itself, they cannot be run while the player is not loaded. Thus, any call to `player` functions must be made in any of the following:
> - A call is made inside `if player:isLoad() then ... end` block i.e. the call checks for the player first.
> - A call is made inside `ENTITY_INIT`, `TICK`, `RENDER` or `POST_RENDER` event.
>
> Not doing so will give the following error: `Tried to access Entity API before its initialization in the ENTITY_INIT event...`
